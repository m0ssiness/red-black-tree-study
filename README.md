Implementation of Red-Black Tree and Binary Search Tree in C++ with performance comparison.

## Features

- Binary Search Tree (BST)
- Red-Black Tree (RBT) with full balancing
- Colored traversal of RBT
- Performance measurement
- Tree validation
- Preset 1 for consequent fill of two trees for comparison
- Preset 2 for random fill
- Till now only manual console I/O

## Building

This project uses CMake

### Commands:
- `i` - insert
